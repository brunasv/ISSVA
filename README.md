# ISSVA
Project to create an OWL file for the [ISSVA classification](https://www.issva.org/UserFiles/file/ISSVA-Classification-2018.pdf).

The International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) is a multidisciplinary international society of physicians, scientists, and health care providers united by an interest in vascular anomalies. The Society aims to promote the highest standards of care for patients with vascular anomalies by advancing clinical and scientific knowledge concerning causes, diagnosis and treatment, and by education of physicians, health care providers, patients and the community. The Society encourages the free flow of information between its members and interested groups, through workshop meetings and teaching programs, and by the dissemination of a classification scheme and pertinent scientific data.

The updated classification was approved at the May, 2018 General Assembly in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.
